/*
S3.Travelling Expanses
3. My wife and I want to go to the UK to attend a conference, and we are trying to make a program that can help us with the expanses

--> You find this oppurtunity a good one, and hopefully this couple could give you a job for making a good budget/expanses program
--> Your program should have :
a. Number of days travel
b. Departure Time
c. Arrival Time
d. Air Fare
e. Car Rental Fare
f. Taxi Fees
g. Hotel Fees
i. Daily Eats.
